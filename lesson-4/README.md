<b>Lesson 4</b>

In this section we went through the following Solidity concepts:
<ul>
<li>Intergrated a Chainlink price aggregator
<li>Created and used a library
<li>Learned about and used multiplication, units of measure and decimal points
<li>Learned more about mappings and arrays
<li>Used a constructor and a modifier
<li>Learned how to send and receive money
<li>Learned the different ways we can interact with our contract to send money (on a low level)
<li>Learned about for loops
</ul>

We deployed the contract to the Goerli testnet under the following address <a href="https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0xfb5526a0397b135eb220ec03ccd424578a4cb82f">0xfB5526A0397b135eb220eC03cCD424578a4cB82f</a>.

<b>Functionality</b>

For this lesson we were working with a contract named FundMe.sol and a library named PriceConverter.sol, with the following functionalities:
<ol>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ans-sigalas/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js/blob/main/lesson-4/FundMe.sol">FundMe.sol</a>
<ul>
<li>Set a minimum funding value in USD.
<li>Have a fund function for users to fund the contract.
<li>Recall the funder's address by using the array number.
<li>Recall the array number by using the funder's address.
<li>Recall who is the owner of this contract.
<li>Withdraw funds from contract to the owner's wallet.
</ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ans-sigalas/full-blockchain-solidity-course-js/blob/main/lesson-4/PriceConverter.sol">PriceConverter.sol</a>
<ul>
<li>This was used as a library for our functions.
</ul>
</ol>
