<b>Lesson 5</b>

In this section we learned the following:

<ul>
<li> How to use Node.js to create new projects.
<li> Learned what the `node` keyword does and how we can use it to run JavaScript in our local development environment.
<li> How to add different dependencies of external packages into our local package using Yarn or NPM.
<li> How to track these packages on package.json and the node_modules folder.
<li> Create a script section on our package.json to minimize long commands into a single keyword.
<li> Basic setup of JavaScript scripts:
    <ul>
    <li> Import packages (top)
    <li> Main function (middle)
    <li> Include a main executor function (bottom)
    </ul> 
<li> Used the `async` keyword so that our functions can run asynchronous programming.
<li> Used the `await` keyword on our asynchronous functions to wait for the promise that what we requested has been executed. 
<li> Connect to any blockchain we want using an RPC_URL.
<li> Connect our provider to a wallet or a private key in ethers.
<li> How to encrypt our private key.
<li> How to run scripts from our encrypted key.
<li> How to create a `.env` file to include sensitive information.
<li> Create a `.gitignore` file to ignore specified files while committing our code on GitHub.
<li> How to compile our contract to get the ABI and BIN of our contract programmatically.
<li> How to interact with our contract programmatically.
<li> How to add a default editor in our settings.json of our VSCode and how to override some of those settings using prettier and .prettierrc file.
<li> Learned how to deploy our contract to a real testnet.
<li> Learned the manual way to verify our contract source code on etherscan.
